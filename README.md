# Transaction-Fraud-Detector

## Problem Statement:
The rapid growth of digital transactions has led to a significant increase in online payment fraud, posing a major threat to financial institutions and their customers. Traditional rule-based fraud detection systems are often slow, rigid, and unable to adapt to the evolving tactics of fraudsters. This results in substantial financial losses and a decline in customer trust. To address this challenge, a robust, data-driven solution is required. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately and efficiently detect fraudulent online payment transactions in real-time, thereby minimizing financial losses and enhancing the security of the digital payment ecosystem.

## Dataset:
The analysis is based on a historical dataset of online transactions. This dataset contains records of both legitimate and fraudulent activities, providing the necessary information to train and evaluate predictive models.
step --------------- tells about the unit of time
type --------------- type of transaction done
amount ------------ the total amount of transaction
nameOrg	----------- account that starts the transaction 
oldbalanceOrg ----- Balance of the account of sender before transaction
newbalanceOrg ----- Balance of the account of sender after transaction
nameDest ---------- account that receives the transaction
oldbalanceDest ---- Balance of the account of receiver before transaction
newbalanceDest ---- Balance of the account of receiver after transaction
isFraud	----------- The value to be predicted i.e. 0 or 1

## Workflow
### Data Overview
* Loaded the dataset and performed an initial inspection to understand its structure, size, and data types.
* Checked for and confirmed the absence of missing values and duplicate records, ensuring data quality.

### Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
* Dropped irrelevant identifier columns (nameOrig, nameDest) that do not contribute to predictive power.
* Engineered new time-based features from the step column to create day, hour_of_day, and time_segment (e.g., Morning, Afternoon), adding valuable temporal context.

### Applied feature encoding techniques
* Label Encoding: Converted the categorical time_segment feature into numerical values.
* One-Hot Encoding: Transformed the type of transaction column into separate binary columns to make it suitable for modeling.

### Model Development
* Split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets, using stratification to maintain the same proportion of fraudulent transactions in both splits.
* Developed a suite of classification models, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and advanced ensemble methods like Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, and XGBoost.
* Systematically evaluated model performance using key metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Cohen Kappa, and ROC AUC score.
* Utilized GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning on the more complex models to optimize their predictive performance.

## Final Model Selection
* Compared all trained models based on their evaluation metrics, with a focus on Cohen Kappa and ROC AUC as strong indicators of performance on an imbalanced dataset.
* Based on the results, the XGBoost Classifier demonstrated superior performance, achieving an outstanding Cohenâ€™s Kappa score of 0.898 and an excellent ROC AUC score of 0.995, indicating high accuracy and strong predictive capability for the target variable.
* Validated the final model's stability and robustness using K-Fold Cross-Validation, which confirmed its high performance with an average ROC AUC score of 0.996.

## Deployment Preparation
* The trained and validated XGBoost model was saved into a final_model.joblib file for deployment in a production environment.

## Key Features Analyzed
- Transaction Type: Categorical feature indicating the nature of the transaction (e.g., CASH_OUT, TRANSFER).
- Transaction Amount: The monetary value of the transaction.
- Account Balances: Balances of both the origin and destination accounts before and after the transaction (oldbalanceOrg, newbalanceOrig, etc.).
- Engineered Time Features: day and time_segment were created to capture temporal patterns in fraudulent activities.

## Tools & Technologies
* Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels)
* Jupyter Notebook

## Future Work
* Deploy the saved model as a real-time API to score incoming transactions and flag potential fraud instantly.
* Develop a monitoring dashboard to track the model's performance in production and identify concept drift.
* Explore more advanced techniques like anomaly detection or graph-based neural networks to capture complex fraud patterns.
* Implement a retraining pipeline to periodically update the model with new transaction data, ensuring it remains effective against new fraud tactics.
